# Movie Trailer Overview

This server side python script was made to generate a page of favorite movies
As of now the `fresh_tomatoes.html` contains six of my favorite movies which was genereated from the `ent_center.py` file.
To generate the same file you can run the `ent_center.py`
To view the page open the `fresh_tomatoes.html` file

# Instructions to add a new movie

You can add your own favorite movies by editing the `ent_center.py`
1. Open the ent_center.py file with an editor
2. Create an instance of a Movie object with four parameters _name, description, link for movie poster, link for movie trailer_
3. Add new instance to the movies list
4. Save and Run `ent_center.py`
5. A page should appear with all instances of Movie objects
